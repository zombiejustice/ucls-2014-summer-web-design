<h1>Mr. H's Homepage</h1>
<p>Mr. H likes making dinosaur noises and teaching people about web design. Mr. H dislikes volcanos and people wearing headphones in class. Actually, he dislikes rudeness in general, not just the headphone thing. And nothing is more rude than a volcano.</p>

<h3>Today we will be continuing our Animal Project.</h3>
<p>You should have by this point selected three animals and found pictures of them.</p>
<p>You should also have folder in your Sites called 'project-animals' and have saved your pictures into it.</p>
<p>Your page should have three articles, each with a headline, a picture, and some text about the animal. You should give credit for the text if you did not write it yourself.</p>
<p>Style the page using CSS! Each of three divs should have an id, and styled distinctly from the other two.</p>
<p>After the break, we will add a link from our homepage to the animal page.</p>
</div>



<p>Mr. H and Fritz are here to teach you web design, but if you have a question, remember to first ask a neighbor, and then try looking it up on w3schools, before raising your hand. Some of the things we've learned so far are:</p>

<h2>From First Week Friday:</h2>
<p>&lt;div&gt;, &lt;section&gt; and &lt;article&gt; define a new blocks, which are invisible boxes used to group other elements together for structure and styling. Think about which one is most appropriate before you use it.</p>
<p>&lt;TAG id='NAME'&gt; is how you give an element an ID. There cannot be two or more elements with the same ID! We will use the ID to style the element individually. "TAG" can be replaced with any element's tag, and "NAME" can be anything you want (just no spaces, and it shouldn't start with a number).</p>
<p>#NAME { CSS } This is how we style an ID. The element with the ID of "NAME" will have all the stylings inside the curly braces.</p>
<p>{ text-align: center } will center text. ONLY use this on TEXT.</p>
<p>{ font-weight: bold } will embolden normal text.</p>
<p>{ font-style: italic } will italicise normal text.</p>
<h2>From First Week Wednesday:</h2>
<p>To connect to the server from the lab, click on the smiley face to select Finder, then open the 'Go' menu and click on 'Connect to Server...'. Enter our MAGIC MYSTERY NUMBER and then, when asked, your username and password. Remember: Everything in your Sites folder is online, everything outside it is not.</p>
<p>&lt;img src='FILENAME.jpg' />&gt; defines an image on the page. Like the link element, img does not close in a separate tag. Replace "FILENAME.jpg" with the picture you want to use. Make sure it's in the right folder!</p>
<p>{ display: block; } This CSS property can be used to display an image as a block. Combine this with automatic margins to center an image.</p>
<p>{ text-align: center; } This is the CSS property for centering text. Do NOT use it to center an image; use the previous property instead.</p>
<p>{ width: SIZEpx; } This CSS property sets the width of block elements such as paragraphs and headlines.</p>
<p>{ border: SIZEpx, STYLE, COLOR; } This CSS property gives block elements a border. SIZE should be a number specified in pixels. STYLE will be the style of the border, such as solid. COLOR will be a color hex code, the color of the border.</p>
<p>{ padding: SIZEpx; } This property will put SIZE pixels between the edge or border of a block element and the text or content.</p>
<p>{ margin: SIZEpx; } This property will put SIZE pixels between the edge or border of a block element and other elements.</p>


<h2>From First Week Tuesday:</h2>
<p>&lt;head&gt; defines the header part of the page, which is not seen directly by users of the webpage. It should begin right after &lt;html&gt; and end with &lt;/head&gt; right before &lt;body&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;title&gt; defines the title of the page, which is not the same as the headline. The title will be displayed at the top of the browser window! Close it with &lt;/title&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;link type='text/css' rel='stylesheet' href='FILENAME.css' /&gt; is the link element. We'll use it to link a stylesheet to our webpage. This is the first element we've learned that doesn't have a separate closing tag; that's why the tag has a slash at the end of it. Replace "FILENAME.css" with the name of your own css file.</p>
<p>{ background-color: #HEXHEX; } This is CSS, and belongs in our stylesheet (our .css file). This property will change the color of the background. Replace "HEXHEX" with the color code of your choice!</p>
<p>{ color: #HEXHEX; } This is another CSS property, which sets the color of the foreground, including text color. Replace "HEXHEX" with the color code of your choice.</p>
<p>{ font-family: "FONT1", "FONT2", FAMILY; } This CSS property sets the font to use. If the browser can't fint FONT1, it will look for FONT2, and so on down the list. The list should always end with one of the five font families: sans-serif, serif, monospace, cursive, or fantasy. There is always a default font for each of these families.</p> 

<h2>From First Week Monday:</h2>
<p>&lt;html&gt; defines the entirity of the webpage. We end the webpage with &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;body&gt; defines the part of the webpage that other people (not webmasters like us) can see. We close the body with &lt;/body&gt; right before &lt;/html&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;h1&gt; defines the most important headline. &lt;h2&gt;, &lt;h3&gt;, and &lt;h4&gt; can also be used. We can have as many of each as we want. Don't forget to close them!</p>
<p>&lt;p&gt; defines a paragraph of text, just like this one. We'll probably use these a lot!</p>
