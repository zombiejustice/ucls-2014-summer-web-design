<p>Most kids are hooked on social media, but S. Johnson never wants to be involved.</p>

<p>Johnson started to see how hooked she was on texting, one of the many types of technology young people use to stay connected to friends.</p>

<p>Johnson purposely stays away from texting and online social media like facebook, instagram, snapchat, and others.</p>

<p>"I do not want to get into it too much," Johnson said. " I stopped because you can not do outside activities."</p>

<p>Johnson started texting on her iPod Touch, but she soon realized that she was texting so much that she became addicted. After she realized how addicted she became, she took big steps to break that addiction.</p>

<p>"I had an iPod and I had my mom hide it from me," Johnson said. "I stopped. Now I only use my iPod when I travel." In this world of constant phone and computer usage, she quit easoily.</p>

<p>"It was easy, but some of my friends kept on telling me not to quit," Johnson said. "Part of the reason I stopped texting is because I wanted to be more focused on ice skating. I like figure skating a lot because I have been doing it for many years."</p>

<p>Her dream is to be a professional ice skater, which is her favorite sport. Because of this daunting dream, Johnson spends numerous hours practicing, and Johnson's siblings have been at the ice rink many of times for her practices.</p>

<p>Her brothers love sports like her.</p>
