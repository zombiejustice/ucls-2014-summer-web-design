<p>Out of all the things in the world, acting and writing makes A. Chiphe happy. When Chiphe acts and writes stories, she explains her feelings.</p>
<p>"I get to be in another world for a while," Chiphe said,  "and all my problems just go away."</p>
<p>Chiphe has acted in Aladdin, The Wizard of Oz,  Peter Pan, and Music Man. This summer Chiphe decided to sign up for the University of Chicago Lab Schools' Summer Lab on Stage. SLOS produces a musical taken from student's suggestions. This year's production will be  Motown songs with an underwater theme. "I think it will be sort of fun because we've had fun practicing the music."</p>
<p>Next year in she is acting in a school production of Beauty And The Beast, where she hopes to play the part of a townsperson.</p>
<p>"I want to play a townsperson because its the easiest role," Chiphe said.</p>
<p>Chiphe's happiness also comes from writing books. One of her first written and illustrated books is called a Trip in The City.</p>
<p>"I wrote it when I was five," Chiphe said. "It was bad but pretty good for a five year old."</p>
<p>Since that time Chiphe has written three more books in which she does not recall the titles.</p>
<p>An asset of writing is spelling another thing Chiphe enjoys. One of Chiphes life goals is to participate in the national spelling bee.</p>
<p>"Because spelling seems really fun," Chiphe said.  "Even if I do not win it's an honor to be chosen to participate in the national spelling bee."</p>
<p>Yet another thing Chiphe finds interesting is volleyball. She has decided she would start next year.</p>
<p>Along with volleyball Chiphe also finds swimming interesting. Last year she was on a swim team then this February she decided to stop. "I had too much other stuff to do," Chiphe said.</p>
<p>When Chiphe isent acting or playing sports she enjoys watching the telly show Glee, Lea Michele plays Chiphe's favorite character.</p>
<p>"She is very strong because her fiance died this year, it was very public," Chiphe said, "and she dealt with it very well," Chiphe continued.</p>
<p>Unlike Glee, acting, and playing sports, Chiphe strongly dislikes the idea of child labor.</p>
<p>"Child labor is very wrong its wrong to have innocent children do your work," Chiphe said,  Instead of working.  They should be able to read a book or be outside playing."</p>
<p>Besides child labor Chiphe also dislikes World War I, "If I could delete one moment in history it would be World War I, It seems like they could just take a vote instead of waring over it. It seems like they asked for people to be killed," Chiphe said.</p>
