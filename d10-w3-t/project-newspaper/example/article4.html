<h4 class='byline'>By L. Draper</h4>

<p>It can be difficult for someone to move to a different city, but D. Kim has moved to Chicago from South Korea, already knowing English. She has lived here for four months now, having moved from Seoul, and is living in Chicago until next February. Kim has been learning English in Korea since the third grade.</p>

<p>"In Korea, people consider English to be important,"  Kim said.  "We have a big test in high school, and English is one of the tests."  This test is important for college selection. She has gone to an academy specifically to learn English, only a few hours after the school day. Her regular school day in Korea starts at eight-thirty.</p>

<p>"I heard high school is more difficult than middle school, but middle school is not very difficult,"  said Kim.  "Korean math is more difficult. "[Testing] is more difficult."</p>

<p>Additionally, Kim wants to be an elementary school teacher.</p>

<p>"I like kids and teaching, and I like studying," Kim said. "She wants to go to Dawon High School in Seoul to better learn English, and Seoul University for college.</p>

<p>Her favorite type of food is Korean food.</p>

<p>"I like spicy food, and Korean food is spicy," Kim said. "My favorite food is tteobokki. It is spicy and good."</p>
