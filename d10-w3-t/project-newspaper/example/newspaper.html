<p>L. Draper is young but he's already trying to reach for his dream. He wants to be a musician.</p>
 
<p>He started music when he was 4 years old; his first instrument was piano. At first, Draper started it because his parents wanted him to learn music, but after his first lesson, he fall in love with music. After he learned how to play piano, he started cello.</p>

<p>"It sounds pretty, as a lot of other people think so," Draper said. "and I can play a lot of music that I like on the cello."</p>

<p>As Draper likes piano and cello, he learned bass and guitar, too. He can't choose his favorite one because he likes every instrument that he can play. Recently, he has been composing songs. He brings music notes to the cafeteria to write down some notes; he is like real musician. He thinks composing will be good experience.</p>

<p>"It helps people be more creative," Draper said.  "It is also interesting to learn a new language, music."</p>

<p>His favorite singer is Freddy Mercury.</p>

<p>"I like Freddie Mercury," Draper said. "He was really talented singer and impressive. He had really high vocal range and his voice sounds operatic. I also like the music that he made, but I can't choose my favorite one because all the songs are very good."</p>

<p>As Freddy Mercury sang rock music, Draper likes it, too. He thinks rock music is the most catchy and the most fun to play.</p>

<p>Besides playing instruments or composing, watching movies is another favorite activity of Draper .</p>

<p>"I like to watch a lot of movies and I like to watch TV shows," Draper said. "I think it's one of the most involving forms of the entertainment."</p>

<p>Draper's favorite movie is Kill Bill. He thinks the movie has good writing and interesting characters. His favorite genre is drama because he thinks the story is important part of the movie. Usually drama movies have good stories.</p>

<p>One year ago, Draper and his father traveled to Ireland, which immediately became his favorite moment.</p>

<p>"There are lots of places to go and Ireland was really pretty," Draper said. "People are nice and foods are good. I want to travel there again."</p>
